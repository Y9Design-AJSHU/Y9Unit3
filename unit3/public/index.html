      <div class="aboutUs">
        <p> Viralert is a service that allows those who are at a high risk of getting a serious illness from COVID-19 to receive tests as soon as possible. Volunteers will drive the tests to you and back to the lab, and will contact you with your results. Because not everyone can afford tests, we ask that if you can, would you please donate to allow us to buy these tests. Thanks! <br><br><b>Created by A.J.
